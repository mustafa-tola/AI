# print("\nHarry Solution")
# print('''Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
# How I wonder what you are!
# Up above the world so high,
# Like a diamond in the sky.

# When the blazing sun is gone,
# When he nothing shines upon,
# Then you show your little light,
# Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

# Then the traveler in the dark
# Thanks you for your tiny spark,
# How could he see where to go,
# If you did not twinkle so?

# In the dark blue sky you keep,
# Often through my curtains peep
# For you never shut your eye,
# Till the sun is in the sky.

# As your bright and tiny spark
# Lights the traveler in the dark,
# Though I know not what you are,

# Exercise 2:-Install any external module you like and perform any operation of that module
# !pip install numpy
# import numpy as np
# np.array([1,2,3])

#Exercise 3:-Print the contents of a directory using os module
# print("Printing the files of current directory")
# import os
# file_names = os.listdir()
# for files in file_names:
#     print(files)

#Exercise 4:-Label the above program with comments
# #Here,We are printing in which directory we are applying our method
# print("Printing the files of current directory")
# import os #importing theos module
# '''using os.listdir() method for getting the names of files in current directory'''
# file_names = os.listdir() 
# #Applying loop on file names got by above method and printing them
# for files in file_names: 
#     print(files)
